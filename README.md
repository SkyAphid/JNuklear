# JNuklear
A simplified wrapper for LWJGL3's Nuklear bindings. This library allows you to quickly make GUIs in LWJGL3 using language more akin to your typical Java library. [Check out the demos folder to see some examples of how the API can be used.](https://github.com/SkyAphid/JNuklear/tree/master/JNuklear/examples/nokori/jnuklear/demo)

*Note: This project is still in early development.*
